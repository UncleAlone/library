# Corse Notes On Dec. 5

<h2 id="SDM">Software Development Method</h2>

**Programming** is a *problem-solving* activity.

Programmers use the **software development method** to solve problems.

Main Steps:

* **Specify:**
  * Specify the problem requirements.
* **Analyze:**
  * Analyze the problem.
* **Design:**
  * Design the algorithm to solve the problem.
* **Implement:**
  * Implement the algorithm.
* **Test And Verify:**
  * Test and verify the completed program.
* **Maintain And Update:**
  * Maintain and update the program.

<h2 id="WYMP">When You Meet A Problem</h2>

* Specifying the problem requirements forces you to state the problem clearly and unambiguously and to gain a clear understanding of what is required for its solution.
* Your objective is to eliminate unimportant aspects and zero in on the root problem. This goal may be as easy to achieve as it sounds. You may find you need more information from the person who posed the problem.
* Analyzing the problem involves <u><b>identifying</u></b> the problem:
  1. inputs, that is, the data you have to work with
  2. outputs, that is, the desired result
  3. any additional requirements or constraints on the solution
* Determine the **required format in which the results should be displayed** (for example, as a table with specific column headings) and develop a list of problem variables and their relationships. These relationships **may be expressed as formulas**.
* If steps 1 and 2 are not done properly, you will solve the **wrong problem**. Read the problem statement carefully.
  * first, to obtain a clear idea of the problem.
  * second, to determine the inputs and outputs.
* You may find it helpful to underline phrases in the problem statement that identify the inputs and outputs, as in the problem statement below.

<h2 id="D">Design</h2>

* Algorithm: a list of steps for solving a problem.
* Top-Down design: "Divide and conquer"
  1. list major steps, or subproblem, that need to be solved.
  2. you solve the original problem by solving each of its subproblem.

* Algorithm for a programming problem
  1. Get the data.
  2. Perform the computations.
  3. Display the results.

<h2 id="T">Testing</h2>

Testing and verifying the program requires testing the completed program to verify that it works as desired.

<br>

***Don't rely on just one test case.(using different sets of data for every situation)***

<h2 id="M">Maintenance</h2>

Maintenance and updating the program involves modifying a program tp remove previously undetected errors and to keep it up-to-date as government regulations or company policies change.

<h2 id="FPP"><b>FAILURE IS PART OF THE PROCESS</b></h2>

* having a step-by-step approach to problem solving is helpful, we must avoid jumping to the conclusion hat if we follow these steps, we are *guaranteed* a correct solution the first time, every time.
* the most important distinction between outstanding problem solvers and less proficient ones is that outstanding problem solvers are not discourages by initial failure.
