# UNIT 1

## Definations

* programming language (is a formal language which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of outputs)
	- Multi-core
	- CPU Sockets
	- Chipsets
	- Frequency (Clock Rate)
	- Hyperthreading
	- Cache
	- Thermal Design Power
* CPU stands for **Central Processing Unit** (is brains of the computer where most calculation take place)
	- Cooling Method
	- Applicable Liquids or Thermal Paste
	- Form Factor
	- Noise Level
* CPU Cooler (is device designed to draw heat away from the system CPU and other components in the enclosure)

* Motherboard (is a printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other decive, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be slotted)
	- Form Factor
	- Processor Socket
	- RAM Compatibility
	- PCI Slots
	- Technical Features
	- SATA/M.2 Slots
* RAM stands for **Random Access Memory** (is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working datd and machine code) 
* SSD stands for **Solid State Drive** 
* HDD stands for **Hard disk Drive**
* Video Card (is an expansion card that allows computers to send graphical information to video display devices such as a monitor, TV and projectors.)
* GPU stands for **Graphical Processing Unit**
* Binary (With binary, we have only two digits to represent a number, 0 and 1.
* Decimals (are number system that uses a notation in which each number is expressed in base 10) 
* Bit (is the smallest unit of data in a computer)
* Byte (is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol.

# Assessment:
* level of programming language(order):
	- Hardware
	- Machine Language
	- Assembly Language
	- High-level Language
	- Visual Language
* Computer Componnets
	- Features (at least 3)
* Number System
	- Binary (0, 1)
	- Decimal (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
	- Why computer use binary? (binary is measured as a two-state system)
	- How to read binary?
* Units of Information
	- Value in bits/bytes
	  * bits ( a bit has a single binary value)
	  * byte (each byte can hold a string of bits)
