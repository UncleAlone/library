# Unit 2

## vecabulary

- **Arduino** refers to an open-source electronics platform or board and the software used to program it.
- **Programming Environment** though Environment Setup is not an element of any Programming Language, it is the first step to be followed before setting on to write a program.
- **User Interface(UI)**
- **Digital** 
- **Analog**
- **Serial**
- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**
- **Microcontroller**
- **Syntax**
- **Programming Algorithm** You can think of a programming algorithm as a recipe that describes the exact needed for the computer to solve a problem or reach a goal.
- **Procedure** the recipe is a procedure
- **Input** the ingredients are called inputs
- **Oupput** the results
- **Flowchart** 
- **Design cycle**

|                | Value/Unit | Description 
| :-------------:| :--------:| :----------:|
|Operational Voltage | 5V | Voltage required to activate the Arduino Uno |
|Digital Pins | 0~13, 14 pins | A pin that can send/receive information High/Low votes only|
|Analog Pins|A0~A5, 6 pins|A pin that can send/receive information  varying voltage|
|Serial Pins|Serial OUT (TX), Serial IN (RX)|Pins taht can send/recevice information between the board and computer|
|PWM|3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11|Pulse Width Modulation|
|Microcontroller|2|Operates the board|
|Programming Language|C/C++|The language used to compile code onto our board|
